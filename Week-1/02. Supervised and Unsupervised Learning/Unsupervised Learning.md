# Unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision.

## Types of Unsupervised Learning:

1. Clustering [K-means]: Clustering is a machine learning technique that involves the grouping of data points. In theory, data points that are in the same group should have similar properties and/or features, while data points in different groups should have highly dissimilar properties and/or features.
   Example: Identification of cancer cells e.t.c

2. Association rule learning [Eclat]: The ECLAT algorithm stands for Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom-up Lattice Traversal. It is one of the popular methods of Association Rule mining. This vertical approach of the ECLAT algorithm makes it a faster algorithm than the Apriori algorithm.
   Example: Indication of how frequently the item set appears in the dataset.

3. Visualization and dimensionality reduction [Principal component Analysis(PCA)] : In machine learning, however, too much data can be a bad thing. Specifically, we will discuss the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm. Now, using a custom plot decision regions function, we will visualize the decision regions.
