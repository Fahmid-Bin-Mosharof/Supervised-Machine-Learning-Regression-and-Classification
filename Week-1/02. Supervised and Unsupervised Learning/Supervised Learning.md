# Supervised learning

Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.

## Types of supervised learning:
1. Classification: Classification is a type of supervised learning. It specifies the class to which data elements belong to and is best used when the output has finite and discrete values. It predicts a class for an input variable as well.
   Example: Spam detection, Churn prediction, Sentiment analysis e.t.c

2. Regression: Regression analysis is a subfield of supervised machine learning. It aims to model the relationship between a certain number of features and a continuous target variable.
   Example: Predicting stock prices, predicting prices of homes e.t.c
