## Feature Scaling

Feature scaling is an essential preprocessing step in machine learning that transforms features to ensure they are on a similar scale. It helps improve the performance and convergence speed of gradient-based algorithms.

### Common Methods

- **Min-Max Scaling (Normalization)**:

  $$
  x' = \frac{x - \min(x)}{\max(x) - \min(x)}
  $$

  - Scales values between 0 and 1.
  - Sensitive to outliers.

- **Standardization (Z-score Normalization)**:

  $$
  x' = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
  $$

  - Centers the data around zero with unit variance.
  - Works well with normally distributed data.

- **Robust Scaling**:
  - Uses the median and interquartile range.
  - Less sensitive to outliers.

## Checking Gradient Descent for Convergence

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a cost function by updating weights iteratively. Convergence means the algorithm has reached a stable solution.

### Methods to Check Convergence

1. **Cost Function Monitoring**:

   - Plot the cost function vs. iterations.
   - If the cost function stabilizes, the algorithm has converged.

2. **Gradient Magnitude**:

   - Compute the norm of the gradient vector.
   - If $ ||\nabla J(\theta)|| $ is close to zero, convergence is achieved.

3. **Change in Parameters**:

   - If successive updates in parameters are negligible, convergence is assumed.

4. **Predefined Number of Iterations**:
   - Run for a fixed number of iterations but ensure it's enough for convergence.

## Learning Rate

The learning rate ($\alpha$) controls the step size of parameter updates in gradient descent. Choosing an appropriate learning rate is crucial for efficient training.

### Choosing the Right Learning Rate

- **Too Small ($\alpha \downarrow$)**:

  - Slow convergence.
  - May get stuck in local minima.

- **Too Large ($\alpha \uparrow$)**:

  - Divergence (cost function increases instead of decreasing).

- **Optimal Learning Rate**:
  - Typically found by experimentation (e.g., grid search, learning rate schedules).
  - Adaptive optimizers (Adam, RMSprop) adjust $\alpha$ dynamically.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful input features for a machine learning model.

### Techniques

- **Handling Missing Values**:

  - Imputation (mean, median, mode).
  - Dropping missing data.

- **Encoding Categorical Variables**:

  - One-hot encoding.
  - Label encoding.

- **Feature Extraction**:

  - Creating new features from existing ones.
  - Example: Extracting day, month, year from a date field.

- **Feature Selection**:
  - Removing irrelevant features to improve model performance.
  - Techniques: Correlation analysis, Mutual Information, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).

## Polynomial Regression

Polynomial regression is an extension of linear regression that models the relationship between features and the target variable as a polynomial function.

### Model Representation

$$
y = \theta_0 + \theta_1x + \theta_2x^2 + ... + \theta_nx^n
$$

### Steps to Implement

1. **Feature Expansion**:

   - Transform the original feature $x$ into polynomial terms (e.g., $x^2, x^3$).
   - Use `PolynomialFeatures` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.

2. **Training the Model**:

   - Fit a linear regression model to the transformed data.
   - Example:

     ```python
     from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
     from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
     from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

     poly_model = make_pipeline(PolynomialFeatures(degree=2), LinearRegression())
     poly_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
     ```

3. **Choosing the Right Degree**:
   - Low degree: Underfitting.
   - High degree: Overfitting.
   - Use cross-validation to find an optimal degree.
